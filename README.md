# Interaction-design-CA

Report:

- I have chosen to updated my SquareEyes website from Design 1 Course Assignment.

- Hotjar: From hotjar i was able to see how differnt users was interacting with my previous website. Through recordings, I could see how other users moved between the different pages, how long they spent on each page and what they clicked on.

- Interview: I interviewed a friend. He reviewed the website and found it generally user-friendly. He made suggestions for improvements. One of them was to fix a search button that I hadn't managed to do before. He also thought that the navigation could have been a little better. The result was that I removed the search button completely and improved the navigation and made an hamburger menu so that it was easier to navigate from page to page.

- Other updates: I also updated the contact form with JavaScript validation.
